## Jonathan So 

My name is Jonathan So and I am a junior in the ECE department. However, 
I recently switched to ECE three weeks ago because I was scarred from EE 233 labs. 
I do not really have a favorite subject in school, but I do enjoy coming here because 
I can meet new people. I am Teochew Chinese which is totally different from any other 
Chinese, which makes me a semi-outcast. I used to be very active in kickboxing but I 
stopped in high school due to time commitments. 

### My favorite foods:
- Soup Dumplings 
- Sushi
- Ramen 
- Eggs
- Boba 

### My favorite songs:
- Hopeless Romanitc - Chini 
- Dope Lovers - DPR Ian
- 6 for 6 - Central Cee 
- 505 - Artic Monkeys 
- Playlist - Kid Travis
